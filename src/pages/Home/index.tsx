              The Training and Placement portal at NIT Hamirpur serves two main purposes. Firstly,
              it serves as a platform for students to access job opportunities, company information,
              and the application process. Secondly, it functions as a placement automation tool for
              the Training and Placement Office (TPO). This means that the TPO team can use the
              portal to streamline the entire placement process, from job postings to candidate
              shortlisting and interview scheduling. Overall, the portal is a valuable resource that
              benefits both students and the TPO team in their efforts to achieve successful
              placements.
